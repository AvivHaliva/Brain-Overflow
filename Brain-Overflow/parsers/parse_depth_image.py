'''

A depth image is a width Ã— height array of floats, 
where each float represents how far the nearest surface from me was,
 in meters. 
 So, if I'd be looking at a chair, 
 the depth of its outline would be its proximity to me 
 (for example, 0.5 for half a meter), 
 and the wall behind it would be farther 
 (for example, 1.0 for one meter).
The best (2D) way to represent it is using matplotlib's heatmap.
